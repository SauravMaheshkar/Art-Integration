# Art-Integration
🎨 My Art Integration Project for Grade 12 (Physics and Computer Science)

# Problem Statement
Compare Delhi and Sikkim on the basis of:

* Production and consumption of electricity
* Renewable sources of energy

Artistic expression has been an integral part of human's growth and development. Over the centuries, as the thrust of education shifted to livelihood, putting the importance of Art in a back seat. Art Integration aims to be a cross-curricular approach to teaching and learning based on collaboration between the teaching of subject with the teaching of Art. This integration is meant not only to make the learning process joyful, but it also lends itself to imbibing a greater appreciation and understanding of the art form being utilised for this purpose.

# 📊 The Data

* [Daily Power Generation in India (2017-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/navinmundhra/daily-power-generation-in-india-20172020)

* [Power consumption in India(2019-2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/state-wise-power-consumption-in-india)

# 😕Miscellaneous

* This was my first time experimenting with `plotly` and `bar_chart_race`, so if you have any suggestions feel free to call me out and suggest changes by opening a **issue**. I don't usually do EDA so please go easy on me.

* This project's activity graph will become dead as this was supposed to be a one-day build.

* If for some reason you want to reproduce this project for learning purposes, I've provided a Dockerfile in case you come across any problems. If you want to experiment with the project download the v0.1-alpha release rather than cloning the repository.
